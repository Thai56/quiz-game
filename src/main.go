   *TODO: Part Two:Adapt your program from part 1 to add a timer. The default time limit should be 30 seconds, but should also be customizable via a flag.

   Your quiz should stop as soon as the time limit has exceeded. That is, you shouldnâ€™t wait for the user to answer one final questions but should ideally stop the quiz entirely even if you are currently waiting on an answer from the end user.
